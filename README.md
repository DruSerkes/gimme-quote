**Get quotes, tweet them out, go nuts**

## Features 
View excellent quotes - get a new one if you so desire - then copy and paste it somewhere or tweet it out to the world!   

## API 
This project uses the [Quotable API](https://api.quotable.io/) to generate random quotes

## Tech 
* React 
* TypeScript 
* Styled Components 

## Why? 
I wanted an excuse to get my feet wet with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/). Also, excellent quotes can be fun, so *why not*?!
